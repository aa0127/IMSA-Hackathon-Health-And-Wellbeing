# IMSA-Hackathon-Health-And-Wellbeing
**Project Name:** Mental Health Matters App

**Project Goals**
The objective of this project was to provide assistance and education to those struggling with the concept of mental health. It clears up certain misconceptions with the quiz feature, while promoting knowledge on the commonality of mental health disorders. We chose the medium of an app, created in code.org’s App Lab, because of the easy to understand user interface. These days, everyone uses apps to go about their day, from checking the weather, paying for a shopping trip, and even waking up in the morning. The user can use the app by “learn” mode or “quiz” mode. Learn mode allows the reader to read factoids about the significance of mental health in our world, and “quiz” mode allows them to test their knowledge. 

There are a lot of misconceptions and insensitivity when it comes to this subject. Many don’t even know if they are mentally ill, and it doesn’t always show like a physical ailment. The truth is, mental illness is a very real issue that is consequential to our overall health. For this reason, the project includes the suicide hotline for those who need it at the end. This project will help the United Nations Sustainability Goal #3 because it considers mental health as a serious problem, and will educate people to feel sympathy, as well as showing the seriousness of the situation.
